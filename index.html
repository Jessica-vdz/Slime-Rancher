                    <h2 class="title"> What is Slime Ranchers?</h2>
                    <p> Slime Ranchers is a fun game that i've been playing for quite a while now.
                        The main goal of the game is to make your slime farm as efficient as possible.
                        You have a big variety of different slimes which all give a different plot.
                        These plots can be sold for a profit. You can combine two slimes by feeding 
                        one slime another plot. When the slime eats the plot they will evolve into a 
                        different slime which will drop two different plots.

                    <h2 class="title"> Development</h2>
                    <p>Development of Slime Rancher started in Popovich's apartment. As Popovich was an artist and designer rather than a programmer, 
                        he relied on other people's code to create a prototype of the game. 
                        He eventually enlisted technical director Mike Thomas to help with the programming. They worked on the game for eight hours a day, a practice Popovich used with employees of Monomi Park to avoid crunch.[13]

                        The game was initially due to enter early access after a year, but was delayed by six months.</p>
