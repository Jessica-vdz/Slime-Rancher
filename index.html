                    Slime Ranchers is a game released in 2017. The main goal of the game is to earn the most money.
                    You suck different slimes in your vacuum and feed them their favorite foods. When the slimes eat
                    they drop a plot which you could sell for money. When you have enough money you can expand you farm 
                    and get more slimes. You can combine slimes but be carefull because when you combine the different 
                    slimes you get an evil slime and they eat the other slimes! so be warned!
